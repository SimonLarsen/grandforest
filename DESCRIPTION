Description: Grand Forest is a graph-guided Random Forest algorithm, integrating secondary
    graph-structured data in order guide the feature selection towards interacting features.
    While it can be used for prediction, the main purpose of Grand Forest is descriptive,
    as it provides an efficient way of discovering highly informative subnetworks.
    Grand Forest is based on ranger.
